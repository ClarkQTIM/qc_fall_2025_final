# Quantum Feature Refraction: Can Variational Quantum Circuits Enhance Classical Features and Leverage NISQ-Era Noise As Regularization?
**Final Project - ELEC/PHYS 5678 Quantum Computing Fall 2025 at the University of Colorado Denver**

This project explores hybrid classical-quantum machine learning pipelines for binary medical image classification using MedMNIST datasets. We implement and compare multiple architectures that combine classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with variational quantum circuits (VQCs).
